# Ballet Master

## Overview

The **Ballet Master** project is a data analysis and exploration project aimed at studying various aspects of ballet masters. This repository contains all the necessary code and data files required to replicate the analysis, along with a script to calculate the number of links associated with each ballet master.

## Contents

- **`analyze.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the analysis. This notebook guides you through the data cleaning, processing, and visualization steps to explore the dataset effectively.

- **`balletmasters_final.csv`**: The primary dataset used in the analysis. This CSV file contains detailed information about various ballet masters, including relevant attributes that are analyzed in the notebook.

- **`balletmasters_numoflink.csv`**: A supplementary dataset containing the number of links associated with each ballet master. This file provides additional context and is used in conjunction with the main dataset in the analysis.

- **`getnum.py`**: A Python script that calculates the number of links for each ballet master. This script processes the relevant data and generates the `balletmasters_numoflink.csv` file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx
